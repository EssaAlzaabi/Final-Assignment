# Adventure Land Ticketing System

## Team Members

This project was developed by a team of three passionate students from Zayed University, aiming to create an efficient and user-friendly ticketing system for a theme park. We are:

- **Essa Salem Alzaabi**
- **Ali Mohammad Alketbi**
- **Ahmad Khalid Belselah**

We worked collaboratively to design and implement a Python-based application that incorporates object-oriented programming principles and provides a seamless experience for users to book tickets for various events.

## Overview

The **Adventure Land Ticketing System** is a Python-based application designed to manage the purchase of various ticket types for a theme park. The system includes a variety of ticket options, such as single-day passes, two-day tickets, annual memberships, group tickets, VIP experiences, family passes, and student discounts. The system also features a GUI for users to interact with the ticketing platform, allowing them to register, log in, and purchase tickets.

This project utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance and abstraction, to model different ticket types and customer interactions. It also uses the `pickle` module to save and load customer and order data from a binary file for persistent storage.

## Features

- **Ticket Classes**: Various ticket types including Single Day, Two Day, Annual Membership, Group Ticket, VIP Experience, Family Ticket, and Student Ticket, each with its own price, validity, and specific discounts.
- **Order Management**: Allows customers to create orders, add tickets, and calculate total costs.
- **Customer Management**: Customers can create accounts, log in, view their order history, and make new purchases.
- **Database**: Customer and order data is saved and loaded using the `pickle` module for persistence.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A Tkinter-based GUI allows customers to interact with the system, make purchases, and manage accounts.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Pickle (for data persistence)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries (Tkinter is typically pre-installed with Python).
3. Run `main.py` to launch the Ticket Booking System.
